# Song-Reversal---Backmasking
Reversing a song by converting .wav file into .dat file and processing the .dat data

This program focuses on implementing a stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) to manipulate digital sound data, specifically to reverse audio clips in a technique known as "backmasking." It involves reading a sound file in .dat format, using a stack to reverse the order of sound data values while maintaining the order of time steps, and writing the reversed data to a new .dat file. The core of the assignment is to modify and implement methods in a provided DblStack.java class using a singly linked list structure and to ensure proper file reading and writing in reverse.java. Testing the stack implementation rigorously with DblStackTest.java and ensuring accurate reversal of audio data without using recursion or queues are key components. Additionally, students are required to answer write-up questions reflecting on their experience and the project's execution. This project is a practical exercise in data structure manipulation, file I/O operations, and understanding the basics of digital sound processing.
